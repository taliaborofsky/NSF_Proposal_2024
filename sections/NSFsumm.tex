\section{Project Summary}
\subsection{Overview}
Different types of cooperative behaviors may select for each other, and cooperative behaviors can have dramatic effects on their ecological communities.


Despite the prominence of cooperatively hunting species in conservation efforts, and their recognition in structuring communities, the ecology of their cooperative hunting behavior is not well understood.

The PI's focus on cooperative hunting primarily, and also on whether it may select for or against reproductive skew


The PI will answer the following questions: (1) Can availability of profitable big prey, combined with competition for less profitable small prey, drive the formation of groups of predators? (2) If predators form groups, do they then drive the prey to extinction, (3) Does reproductive skew limit or encourage the evolution of cooperative hunting? 

\subsection{Intellectual Merit}
Evolution of social behavior and ecology
some social behavior incorporated into predator-prey models, primarily in prey, but not in predators in a way that reflects the trade-offs of cooperation, i.e., weighing the benefit of accessing new types of prey versus having to share what is caught. 

Additionally, exploring how different cooperative behaviors reciprocally create a niche.

\subsection{Broader Impacts}
% There are 4 kinds of broader impacts.
% 1. advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching,
% training and learning
% 2. broaden the participation of underrepresented groups
% 3. disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological
% understanding
% 4. benefits of the proposed activity to society
