\section{Project Description}
\subsection{Introduction}

Many predators that are widely known to structure their local communities, such as orcas \cite{estes_killer_1998, valls_keystone_2015}, and wolves \cite{c_eisenberg_wolfs_2013}, are also very social. The social behaviors of these predators can act as niche constructors, with their evolution both being shaped and shaping the local ecosystem \cite{odling-smee_niche_1996}. 

However, theoretical and empirical studies on the niche construction of predator social behavior has been limited. This gap is a deficit in evolutionary analyses as well as in ecology and conservation biology because many animals that are widely known to structure their local communities are also very social, such as sea otters  \cite{estes_killer_1998, estes_sea_2016}, orcas \cite{estes_killer_1998, valls_keystone_2015}, and wolves \cite{c_eisenberg_wolfs_2013}. The few empirical studies that examined this topic found that their social behavior can alter and be altered by their interactions with other species \cite{jordaan_effect_2023, imbert_why_2016, foster_social_2012, zimmermann_predatordependent_2015}. Very little modeling has studied the influence of the evolution of social behavior on the population dynamics of predators and prey. Previous work has examined how the evolution of social learning and cooperation influences prey choice and prey population dynamics in a one-predator, two-prey model where the predator population was held constant \cite{borofsky_static_2022, borofsky_success-biased_2022, borofsky_cultural_2024}, and one model has examined the influence of social learning by predators in a one predator, one prey model where both populations changed \cite{kikuchi_social_2023}. A cluster of mathematical modeling on cooperative hunting in predator-prey models have modeled cooperation as an allee effect, assuming the capture rate of prey is a function of predator density rather than group size \citep[e.g.][]{berec_impacts_2010, teixeira_alves_hunting_2017}, even though studies of group-living species have largely been unable to observe population-level allee effects \cite{lerch_why_2018}. 

Additionally, group structured-populations remain a challenge to ecological and evolutionary models of social behavior. Group-selection models have sought to examine how cooperative traits may spread by increasing the competitive advantage, and hence relative fitness, of groups with more cooperators, but these models generally do not both allow for group formation and for for individuals to leave or join groups if it will increase their own fitness \cite{traulsen_evolution_2006, simon_towards_2013}. There is a need for a group formation model that examines how cooperative behaviors emerge and spread when they originate in groups in which group members can leave in pursuit of higher fitness. In addition, many social predators are increasingly recognized to live in groups with flexible group membership \cite{smith_social_2008} \red{(also unpublished observations from Adrian Treves of wolves switching groups - should I ask him about including this?)}. Of the few models of coopertive hunting in which cooperative hunting kill rates depended on group size rather than predator density, all predators lived in groups of the same size, and group hunting seemed to prevent cycling and stabilize equilibria in which predators and prey coexisted \cite{fryxell_group_2007}. It is unclear how predators with flexible group formation may influence prey dynamics differently than do predators that all live in groups of the same size.

We will focus on cooperative hunting in social predators. Cooperative hunting describes predators hunting a prey item as a group and sharing the resulting kill, and may be most advantageous if it allows predators to expand their ecological niche by hunting prey they could not catch otherwise. Our project will address the followign questions: (1) Can the availability of large prey that is difficult to catch alone cause predators to form large groups? (2) How does flexible group formation influence the predator and prey population dynamics?

In addition, we will study fecundity altruism in predators, and how the evolution of fecundity altruism is influenced by cooperative hunting. Fecundity altruism occurs when one organism sacrifices part or all of its potential to reproduce so the recipient of the altruism can increase its own reproduction. For example, in ant colonies only the queen reproduces whereas the worker ants perform tasks such as foraging or caring for the brood instead of reproducing \cite{holldobler1990ants}. A previous model in which, at the beginning of every generation, resources were completely renewed and juvenile predators randomly aggregated in groups of the same size, cooperation that enhanced access to resources decreased local competition between group members, making them more likely to help each other breed \cite{van_dyken_origins_2012_II}. ALSO THE MODEL BY FRONHOFER ET AL INDICATED EUSOICALITY/SKEW INCREASED RESOURCE USE EFFICIENCY BY ALLOCATING SCARCE RESOURCES TO ONLY A FEW WHO WERE MORE ASSURED TO REPRODUCE 2018. However, it remains to be seen HOW FLEXIBLE GROUP FORMATION WILL INFLUENCE THE EVOLUTION OF FECUNDITY ALTRUISM, particularly under the more realistic assumption marginally diminishing returns of hunting success of big prey from increasing group size \citep[for examples, see][]{macnulty_influence_2014, holekamp_hunting_1997, fanshawe_factors_1993, caraco_ecological_1975}. 

To address these questions, we proposes to conduct three projects:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A one predator, two-prey model in which single predators can leave and form groups. 
\item A model of group dynamics in which larger groups access more profitable resources (e.g., through cooperative hunting of big prey), where we analyze the evolution of fecundity altruism.
\item A meta-analysis of cooperative hunting behavior, group dynamics, and reproductive cooperation across Carnivora
\end{enumerate}

The predator population, with population size $p$, hunts two types of prey: big prey, with population size $M_1$, and small prey, with population size $M_2$. Big prey and small prey are also referred to as prey types 1 and 2, respectively. Predators are split into hunting groups that are of size $x \in 1, 2, \cdots, p$. Let $f(x,t)$ be the number of groups of size $x$, which for brefity is also written as $f(x)$, so that the portion of predators in a group of size $x$ is $\bar{f}(x) = x f(x)/p$. The population dynamics of predators and prey are 
\begin{subequations} \label{general_model}
\begin{align}
\frac{dp}{dt} &=  \sum_{x=1}^{\xm} f(x) \lrb{b_1 Y_1(x,M_1,M_2) + b_2 Y_2(x,M_1,M_2)} - p \delta \\
\frac{dM_1}{dt} &= g_1 M_1 \lrp{1 - \frac{M_1}{k_1}}  -  \sum_{x=1}^{\xm} f(x) Y_1(x,M_1,M_2) \\
\frac{dM_2}{dt} &= g_1 M_1 \lrp{1 - \frac{M_1}{k_1}}  -  \sum_{x=1}^{\xm} f(x) Y_2(x,M_1,M_2)
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where the parameters are defined in Table \ref{originalparameters} and $Y_i(x,M_1,M_2)$ is the functional response on prey $i$. The functional responses are defined as the rate of prey caught per hunting \textit{entity}, i.e. a solitary predator or predator group, so the fitness from hunting in a group is shared across the group. We explore type I and type II functional response, two common ways of modeling kill rates of predators \cite{hamilton_genetical_1964}, but the kill rate is for a huting group of size $x$, namely
\begin{equation} \label{fun_response}
Y_i(M_1, M_2, x) = \frac{a_i \alpha_i(x) M_i}{1 + \sum_{j=1,2} a_j \alpha_j(x) h_j(x) M_j}, 
\end{equation}

\label{fig_capture_rates}
\end{wrapfigure}
for $i = 1,2$, for $a_i$ the encounter rate, $\alpha_i(x)$ the capture probability, and $h_i(x)$ the handling time of prey types $i=1,2$, i.e., the big prey and small prey, respectively. Using data from previous empirical studies of kill rates by groups of cooperative hunters such as wild dogs \cite{creel_communal_1995, fanshawe_factors_1993}, wolves \cite{zimmermann_predatordependent_2015, macnulty_influence_2014} and lions \cite{caraco_ecological_1975, clark_lazy_1987}, we will explore two variations of the functional response: (1) cooperative hunting increases the capture probability $\alpha_1(x)$ of big prey, i.e. the probability a predator captures prey $i$ upon encounter, (2) cooperative hunting enables predators to consume and monopolize big prey more quickly, decreasing handling time $h_i(x)$ and increasing the conversion constant $b_i$. For example, for the case in which cooperative hunting increases capture probability, previous data suggests that any increase in capture probability from increasing group size levels off or even decreases as group sizes grow large \cite[e.g.]{macnulty_influence_2014}, so capture probability could be modeled as 
%NEED TO CLARIFY IF THIS IS FOR BIG PREY OR SMALL PREY
\begin{equation}
\alpha_i(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta_i(x - s_i)}}  
\end{equation}
The parameters $\theta_i$, $s_i$ are the steepness and critical group size of the capture probability for prey $i$, but this combination of parameters is not very intuitive for understanding how the capture probability responds to group size. For clarity, we instead use the parameters $\alpha_i(1), s_i$, where $\alpha_{i}(1)$ is the capture probability of prey $i$ by solitary predators, $\theta_i = - \frac{\ln\lrp{ \frac{1}{\alpha_i(1)} -1 }}{1 - s_i}$ (Fig. \ref{fig_capture_rates}).

Predators may leave and join groups multiple times within their lifespan. The time constant for group dynamics is $\tau_x$. While time for the population dynamics processes in system eqs. \ref{general_model} is on the order of years or seasons, time for group dynamics may be on the order of days, so $\tau_x << 1$. Thus the group size distribution changes from the following processes: (1) solitary individuals join group of size $x$ at rate $\psi(x)$, (2) individuals leave groups of size $x$ at rate $\phi(x)$, (3) Individuals die at rate $\delta \tau_x$, the death rate relative to the time scale of group dynamics, and (4) individuals are born at a rate that is the yield from hunting, adjusted for the group formation time scale, i.e. $\tau_x f(x) \pi(x)$ , where $\pi(x) = b_1 Y_1(x) + b_2Y_2(x)$ is the yield from hunting. After birth, offspring initially are in their natal group unless they are born in a group of the maximum group size, in which case they become solitary. The master equations for the number of solitary individuals, the number of groups of size 2, and number of groups of size $x \geq 2$, are, respectively,
\begin{multline} \label{df_of_1}
\tau_x \pdv{f(1)}{t} =\ + \underbracetwo{2 \cdot f(2) \phi(2)}{groups of 2}{split to two solitaries} \ +  \underbracetwo{\sum_{x=3}^{\xm} f(x) \phi(x)}{individuals leave}{larger groups}\

\end{multline}
and for $x > 2$,
\begin{multline} \label{df_dt}
\tau_x \pdv{f(x)}{t} = -\underbracetwo{  f(x) \phi(x) }{an individual}{leaves} \ - \ \underbracetwo{f(x) \psi(x) }{growing to}{larger group} \ +\ \underbracetwo{f(x-1)\psi(x-1)}{smaller group}{grows to size $x$} + \underbracetwo{f(x+1)\phi(x+1)}{a member leaves}{a larger group}\\
+ \tau_x \lrc{ f(x-1)\pi(x-1) - f(x) \pi(x) + \delta \lrb{(x+1)f(x+1) - xf(x)} }.
\end{multline}

Let $S(x,y)$ be the best response function modeling the probability a decision-maker will transition from a group of size $y$ to a group of size $x$, for $x,y \geq 1$, $y \leq \xm$, and $x \leq \xm - 1$. If predators can freely leave and join groups, then that decision-maker is the predator that is deciding whether to leave or join a group. If groups decide whether to admit or eject members, the decision-maker could be either any subordinate individual in a group or the dominant individual. This function is sigmoidal in shape, growing closer to $1$ as the per capita fitness difference $\frac{1}{x} \pi(x) - \frac{1}{y}\pi(y)$ increases. We model this choice using Tullock's contest success function \cite{tullock_efficient_1980}, i.e.,
\begin{equation} \label{best_response_function}
S(x,y) = \frac{\lrp{\frac{1}{x}\pi(x)}^d}{\lrp{\frac{1}{x} \pi(x)}^d + \lrp{\frac{1}{y}\pi(y)}^d}
\end{equation}
for $d$ a positive scaling constant that determines the shape of $S(x,y)$. If individuals can freely join or leave groups, the rate at which individuals join a group of size $x$ is
\begin{equation}
\psi(x) = 
\begin{cases}
f(1) S(x+1,1)  & \text{if } x \leq \xm - 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
and the rate at which they leave a group of size $x$ will be $\phi(x) = xS(1,x)$ for $x \leq \xm$.  

This model can be partially non-dimensionalized, scaling the population sizes of big prey and small prey by their carrying capacities, so $N_1 = M_1/k_1$ for big prey and $N_2 = M_2/k_2$ for small prey. The population time-scale constant is $\hat{t} = g_1 + g_2 + \delta$, with non-dimensionalized time $T = t \hat{t}$ and the group dynamics time constant $T_x = \hat{t} \tau_x$. For $\xi = \hat{t}/(a_1 + a_2)$ the ratio of the predation-independent growth rates to the attack rates, the predator population is scaled to $P = p/\xi$ and the number of groups of size $x$ is $F(x) = f(x) /\xi$. The new parameters are $\eta_i = g_i/\hat{t}$, $A_1 = a_1/(a_1 + 1_2)$, $\beta_i = a_i b_i k_i/\hat{t}$, and $H_i = a_i h_i k_i$. It is not useful to non-dimensionalize group size, $x$.

\subsubsection{Plan for Analysis and Preliminary results}
% I SHOULD LINK THESE BACK TO THE OBJECTIVES
To examine the influence of flexible group formation on population dynamics, we will compare the model described in eqs. \ref{general_model}a - c and eqs. \ref{df_of_1} - \ref{df_dt} to a model in which all predators are in groups of size $x^*$, described by eqs. \ref{general_model}a - c with $f(x) = p/x$ for $x = x^*$ and 0 otherwise. Initial results indicate that whereas restricting group sizes to stay at a constant $x^*$ can lead to one prey type going extinct, allowing fission-fusion dynamics of group sizes results in both prey types and predators coexisting. We will examine whether availability of big prey increases mean group size of predators by looking at the mean group size in response to increases in (1) the scaled benefit of big prey, $\beta_1$, (2) the scaled growth rate of big prey, $\eta_1$, and (3) the equilibrium density of big prey, $M_1^*$. Finally, to examine the properties of predator behavior and prey growth for which extinction of any of the three populations may occur, we will examine the range of parameters for which extinction of either prey type is locally stable using linear stability analysis. %Finally, we will examine the presence or absence of apparent competition, as defined in \cite{holt_predation_1977}, between prey types, and whether apparent competition depends on group dynamics.



\subsection{Project 2: The Evolution of Reproductive Skew across Dynamic Groups}

Noted for us:
The goal of this project is to determine if groups with reproductive skew will emerge if a) groups have increased productivity (e.g. through cooperative hunting) but have to share what they produce, and b) reproductive skew increases that productivity further. 

The challenges of this project are to figure out a) the time dynamics of relatedness in the groups that form, b) what happens to a reproductive skew mutant in a group of wild types (does it donate more to the existing dominant?), c) how individuals decide whether to join or leave groups, and d) how reproductive skew might enhance productivity (indirectly through some kind of multiplication factor? or more explicitly through more efficient allocation of time and energy budgets?)

A way to address these challenges is to focus on a special case of the group dynamics model, where the population is made up of singletons and pairs, i.e. $x_max = 2$. An alternative way to simplify the model is to eliminate joining of groups, so groups only grow from births; after all, many cooperatively hunting animal groups are made up of a reproductive unit and offspring that have not yet dispersed (e.g. wolves). Of the animals that enter the group, they are often the opposite sex of the dominant reproducer in the group, who are enteringt to be a mate for sexual reproduction, but since we are not modeling sexual reproduction anyways then why worry about this?


DO I NEED THE SMALL PREY VS BIG PREY HERE, OR IS IT ENOUGH TO JUST SAY THEY GET A BIG YIELD IN A GROUP BUT IT HAS TO BE SHARED, THEY GET A SMALL YIELD ALONE BUT IT'S ALL THEIRS.
\subsubsection{Cooperative Hunting}
Predators can hunt large prey, which has benefit $b_1$ before sharing, or hunt small prey which has benefit $b_2$ before sharing. There are no population dynamics of big prey and small prey, but predator grouping increases the capture probability of big prey. The rate at which predator groups catch prey is similar to eq. \ref{fun_response} but $M_1, M_2 = 1$. Since there should be a trade-off between the amount of effort spent on one prey on the amount of effort available on the other prey, there is handling time for prey, but since handling time is not the focus, it is set to $h_1 = h_2 = h$. Additionally, to increase tractibility the attack rates of both prey are the same and set at $a_1 = a_2 = 1$. Thus if all predators spend all their time foraging, then the group's yield (i.e. number of offspring) from hunting is
\begin{equation} \label{fun_response_2}
\pi(x) = \frac{b_1 \alpha_1(x) + b_2 \alpha_2(x)}{1 +  h \alpha_1(x) + h \alpha_2(x)} \qquad \text{for }
\alpha_i(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta_i(x - s_i)}}.
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Reproductive Skew}
Reproductive skew will be represented in one of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Public Goods Game: If the yield from prey is first split evenly, such that each individual in a group of size $x$ receives yield $\frac{1}{x} \pi(x)$, and subordinates sacrifices a portion $\gamma$ to the dominant, then the direct fitness of subordinates is $w_s(x) = \frac{\pi(x)}{x}(1-\gamma)$ and that of the the dominant is $u\frac{1}{x} \pi(x) \lrb{1 + \gamma(x-1)}$, where $u>1$ is a multiplication factor.
\item Division of Time Budgets: Predators split their time between foraging and reproducing, so by sacrificing a portion of their reproductive effort $\gamma$, subordinates also decrease their time reproducing by $\gamma$ and thus spend more time hunting. The dominant decreases its time hunting by $\gamma$ for each subordinate in the group. Thus as $\gamma$ increases, the expected number of hunters that are actively hunting at any given moment of time increases.
%\item Decreasing Sunk Costs: The amount of reproduction a predator can do with respect to how much food it receives is sigmoidal. Then if a group does not hunt a lot of food and shares it evenly, everyone reproduces very little, but if the dominant instead receives most of the food, their collective reproduction is much higher. THIS WOULD SELECT FOR REPRODUCTIVE SKEW IF THERE IS A LOT OF STOCHASTICITY
\end{enumerate}
%Let $w_s(x), w_d(x)$ be the direct fitnesses of a subordinate and a dominant, respectively. WHAT IF WE EXPLORE GROUP SELECTION THEORIES WITH NO RELATEDNESS? HOW ARE WE DEFINING THIS RELATEDNESS ANYWAYS? RELATEDNESS RELATIVE TO RELATEDNESS IN THE POPULATION? For $r_s$ the average relatedness between subordinates in a group and $r_d$ the average relatedness between subordinates and the dominant in a group, the inclusive fitness of subordinates and the dominant are
%$$
%W_s(x) = w_s(x)\lrb{ 1 + r_s (x-2) } + r_d w_d(x) \qquad \text{and} \qquad W_d(x) = w_d + r_d (x-1) w_s(x), 
%$$
%respectively. 


\subsubsection{Group Fission and Fusion}
As in project 1, $f(x)$ is the number of groups of size $x$. Here, offspring initial stay in their native group. One individual in a group is a dominant and the rest are subordinates, but every group member has a uniform probability $1/x$ of being a dominant. As in Project 1, $\psi(x), \phi(x)$ are the rates at which predators join and leave a group, respectively. If predators are able to freely leave and join groups, then when a predator is deciding to join or leave a group, it compares its solitary fitness to the expected fitness in the group. If groups control whether predators can stay or join, then a predator leaves a group if the group's fitness increases by decreasing group size. A predator joins a group if its own fitness increases by joining the group and if the group's fitness increases by augmenting group size. Since this model does not focus on population dynamics, population size is held constant by balancing the birth rate of the population with the death rate. For $W(x)$ the total birth rate of a group of size $x$, then because $\sum_x f(x) \pi(x)$ is the overall birth rate of the population, the per-capita death rate is $\delta = \frac{1}{p} \sum_x f(x) \pi(x)$ for $p = \sum_x x f(x)$ the constant population size.

\red{
For evolution, we would have to look at $f(x,m)$, the density of groups of size $x$ with $m$ mutants, where $m = 1, 2, \cdots, x$. A reproductive skew mutant that at probability $1/x$ is a dominant just receives what everyone else gives it, but at probability $(x-1)/x$ it is a subordinate and gives up portion $\gamma'$ of its food. We want to look at the probability it stays versus a non-mutant and what its rate of increase is
$f(x,m)$ undergoes transitions from mutants increasing and from group size increasing. for instance the group transitions to $x,m \Rightarrow x+1, m+1$ from birth at rate $m W'(x,m)$ where $mW'(x,m)$ is the reproduction of the mutant}

\subsection{Project 3: The Presence of Cooperative Hunting, Cooperative Breeding, and Group Formation across Carnivora}
This project explores trends in the social behavior and ecology of Carnivora with the aim of comparing the ecology and social behaviors of predators that hunt alone, those that hunt in groups but do not cooperate, and those that both hunt in groups and cooperate. Previous work exploring the diversity of social hunting strategies has focused on exploring types of hunting behaviors among predators that are social, rather than doing a thorough comparison of species that are solitary and social \cite{hansen_mechanisms_2023, lang_multidimensional_2017, bailey_group_2013}. In particular, wes intend to investigate whether predators that hunt cooperatively also breed cooperatively. The project will focus on Carnivora because it is a relatively small order (only around 270 species) made up of predators that contains well known examples of cooperative hunters, solitary hunters, and cooperative breeders, including some species that use a mix of solitary hunting and cooperative hunting.

In order to understand ecological factors which select for cooperative hunting, assess whether group hunters tend to also breed cooperatively, and look for signatures of co-evolution between reproductive skew and cooperative hunting, we will collect the following information, where available, on species of carnivora:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Group Hunting Characteristics} - Whether the predator hunts in groups, the size of those groups, the degree of collaboration and sharing while hunting, and whether both sexes or just one sex hunts in groups.
\item \textbf{Cooperative Breeding} - Whether females raise young in groups (i.e., in the presence of adult conspecifics), the degree of reproductive skew in groups, whether some adults help rear the young of other adults, and the presence of infanticide in groups.
\item \textbf{Prey characteristics} - The types of prey hunted in groups and alone, the size of the prey relative to the predators, and the sociality of the prey.
\end{enumerate}
