	abstract = {From an evolutionary perspective, social behaviours are those which have ﬁtness consequences for both the individual that performs the behaviour, and another individual. Over the last 43 years, a huge theoretical and empirical literature has developed on this topic. However, progress is often hindered by poor communication between scientists, with different people using the same term to mean different things, or different terms to mean the same thing. This can obscure what is biologically important, and what is not. The potential for such semantic confusion is greatest with interdisciplinary research. Our aim here is to address issues of semantic confusion that have arisen with research on the problem of cooperation. In particular, we: (i) discuss confusion over the terms kin selection, mutualism, mutual beneﬁt, cooperation, altruism, reciprocal altruism, weak altruism, altruistic punishment, strong reciprocity, group selection and direct ﬁtness; (ii) emphasize the need to distinguish between proximate (mechanism) and ultimate (survival value) explanations of behaviours. We draw examples from all areas, but especially recent work on humans and microbes.},

	abstract = {We investigate the social transmission of innovations between predators. We focus on two classic predator-prey models. We assume that innovations increase predator attack rates or conversion efficiencies, or that innovations reduce predator mortality or handling time. We find that a common outcome is the destabilization of the system. Destabilizing effects include increasing oscillations or limit cycles. Particularly, in more realistic systems (where prey are self-limiting and predators have a Type II functional response), destabilization occurs due to overexploitation of the prey. Whenever instability increases the risk of extinction, innovations that benefit individual predators may not have positive long-term effects on predator populations. Additionally, instability could maintain behavioral variability among predators. Interestingly, when predator populations are low despite coexisting with prey populations near their carrying capacity, innovations that could help predators better exploit their prey are least likely to spread. Precisely how unlikely this is depends on whether or not naïve individuals need to observe an informed individual interact with prey to learn the innovation. Our help illuminate how innovations could affect biological invasions, urban colonization, and the maintenance of behavioral polymorphisms.},

	abstract = {Explaining the evolution and maintenance of animal groups remains a challenge. Surprisingly, fundamental ecological factors, such as resource variance and competition for limited resources, tend to be ignored in models of cooperation. We use a mathematical model previously developed to quantify the influence of different group sizes on resource use efficiency in egalitarian groups and extend its scope to groups with severe reproductive skew (eusocial groups). Accounting for resource limitation, the model allows calculation of optimal group sizes (highest resource use efficiency) and equilibrium population sizes in egalitarian as well as eusocial groups for a broad spectrum of environmental conditions (variance of resource supply). We show that, in contrast to egalitarian groups, eusocial groups may not only reduce variance in resource supply for survival, thus reducing the risk of starvation, they may also increase variance in resource supply for reproduction. The latter effect allows reproduction even in situations when resources are scarce. These two facets of eusocial groups, resource sharing for survival and resource pooling for reproduction, constitute two beneficial mechanisms of group formation. In a majority of environmental situations, these two benefits of eusociality increase resource use efficiency and lead to supersaturation—a strong increase in carrying capacity. The increase in resource use efficiency provides indirect benefits to group members even for low intra‐group relatedness and may represent one potential explanation for the evolution and especially the maintenance of eusociality and cooperative breeding.},

	abstract = {A general continuous model is presented for animal group size distribution. Attention is restricted to a fixed size population divided into groups of various dynamic sizes, but the approach extends easily to populations of variable size. The basic idea is to relate group size distribution to two functions, the (densitydependent) rates of fusion and fission. These functions can be estimated from data and can ultimately be related to the behavior of individuals and the dynamics of groups. For various functional forms, the stationary distributions of group sizes are sought. In several prototype cases, the stationary distribution has a peak value, the "most frequent group size," which emerges endogenously from the dynamics. The authors determine when such a peak emerges and more generally show the existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution. Stability of stationary solutions is discussed. Progress is shown, but a general treatment remains refractory.},
